**MyFolderOrganizer!** is a simple yet effective tool designed to help you clean up your messy folders by organizing files based on their extensions. Whether you have a Downloads folder that's a total chaos or just want to keep things neat and tidy, this application does the job for you!

## Features

- Supports a variety of file types such as text, PDF, images, videos, archives, audio, and more.
- Allows users to specify custom extensions that are not included by default.
- Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that requires minimal input from the user.
- Built as a standalone `.exe` application so that users without Python installed can use it without any hassle.

## Why I Made This Project

One day, I decided to open my Downloads folder after years of neglect, and what I saw was... well, let's say it was "total chaos!" Out of sheer boredom and a desire to make my first GUI program, I created this humble project to clean up not only my digital mess but yours as well!

## How to Use

1. **Download and run the `.exe` file**.
2. **Enter the directory** of the folder you want to organize.
3. **Select the types (extensions) of files** you want to group together.
4. **Click on "Organize My Folder!"** and let the app do its magic!

## Getting Started

You can download the `.exe` file from the [Releases](#) section on GitHub.
